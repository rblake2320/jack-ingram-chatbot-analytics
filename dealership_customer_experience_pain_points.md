Based on industry research and the extracted requirements from the provided documentation, the following are key pain points in the automotive dealership customer experience that can be addressed by an analytics-enabled chatbot solution.

## 1. After-Hours Information Access

**Pain Point**: 30-40% of website visitors browse after dealership business hours (typically after 6 PM), leaving their questions unanswered and potentially losing these customers to competitors.

**Impact**: 
- Lost sales opportunities
- Reduced lead capture
- Customer frustration leading to abandonment
- Competitive disadvantage

**Evidence**: According to the provided documentation, a significant portion of potential customers browse dealership websites outside of business hours, when no staff is available to answer questions or provide assistance.

## 2. Fragmented Communication Channels

**Pain Point**: Customers must navigate multiple communication channels (phone, email, website forms, social media) to get information, leading to inconsistent experiences and lost information.

**Impact**:
- Customer frustration from repeating information
- Inconsistent messaging across channels
- Missed follow-up opportunities
- Lack of conversation history and context

**Evidence**: Dealership websites typically have separate contact forms for sales, service, parts, and general inquiries, forcing customers to determine which department they need and potentially submit multiple forms.

## 3. Slow Response Times

**Pain Point**: Traditional lead follow-up processes can take hours or even days, while 90% of customers expect responses within 10 minutes.

**Impact**:
- Customer impatience leading to competitor engagement
- Perception of poor service quality

**Evidence**: Research by SuperOffice indicates that 90% of customers view an instant response as crucial or very important when seeking assistance, with 60% defining "instant" as within 10 minutes.

- Increased time-to-purchase
- Missed opportunities when customers can't find what they want
- Poor user experience on mobile devices

**Evidence**: The documentation notes that Jack Ingram Motors has over 700 vehicles across six brands, making manual filtering cumbersome and time-consuming for customers.

**Impact**:

**Impact**:
- Financing anxiety delaying purchase decisions

**Evidence**: While Jack Ingram Motors offers financing options and works with 25+ lenders, customers currently have limited self-service tools to explore these options before visiting the dealership.

**Impact**:

**Evidence**: The documentation indicates that service appointment scheduling is available online but may not be optimized for conversational interfaces or mobile users.

**Impact**:
